## Content Formulas

### Headlines (H1)

**Formula 1: Aspiration + Action**
```
[Desired Outcome] + [How We Deliver]
Example: "Where vision meets velocity"
```

**Formula 2: Problem + Solution**
```
[What You Need] + [How We Provide It]
Example: "Enterprise-grade products without enterprise timelines"
```

**Formula 3: Direct Value Proposition**
```
[Clear Offer] + [Unique Qualifier]
Example: "SaaS MVPs built in 6 weeks, not 6 months"
```

### Subheadlines (H2)

**Formula: Expand + Specify**
```
[Benefit] + [Proof/Process/Details]
Example: "Ship production-ready code with architecture that scales to 100K+ users"
```

### Body Copy

**Formula: Problem → Agitation → Solution**
```
1. Acknowledge pain point
2. Emphasize cost of inaction
3. Present solution + benefit
4. Include specific proof/data

Example:
"Your development team is stretched thin, and that product idea keeps getting pushed back. [Problem]
Every month of delay is revenue you're not capturing and market share you're losing. [Agitation]
We specialize in rapid MVP development—delivering products in 6-8 weeks with production-grade architecture. [Solution]
Our clients launch 3-4x faster than hiring in-house while maintaining investor-ready quality." [Proof]
```

### Primary CTAs

**Strong, action-oriented:**
- "Start your project"
- "Book a strategy call"
- "Get started"

- "Read our approach"
- "Request project breakdown"

### CTA Best Practices

1. **Use first-person for user actions**
   - ✅ "Start my project"

2. **Create urgency (when genuine)**
   - ✅ "Limited Q2 availability — Apply now"
   - ❌ "Limited time offer!" (salesy)

3. **Reduce friction**
   - ✅ "Book a 15-minute call" (specific, low commitment)
   - ❌ "Contact us" (vague, high friction)

4. **Align with user intent**
   - Top of funnel: "Explore services"
   - Bottom of funnel: "Start your project"
